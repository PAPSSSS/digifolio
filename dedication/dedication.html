			<p> I have a lot of plans for the future, one of which is to become a streamer and become a pro player, become rich, and improve my life. We have many goals in life that we want to fulfill and we lack dedication. Many people have been part of our lives and they are probably the reason why we have the desire to be able to learn from them, they may have been the ones who caused the pain that taught us to be strong and they were the ones who helped us.Recognizing them is a part of our lives because it is proof that we have learned something in every area of life. As the people around me have been the reason why I want to fulfill and prove something from my dream of becoming a streamer and a pro player and my squadmates and loved ones who have brought me joy. The problems that have led to the lesson of self-recognition first before others anf be humble.
			SOME PEOPLE
succeed
BECAUSE THEY ARE
destined BUT MOST BECAUSE THEY ARE
determined
